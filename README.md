# Object Oriented JavaScript : Weather Monitor Widget

A web page component that allows a user to monitor weather forecasts for different towns.

Functionality:
The application has been implemented in the form of a 'widget' – it is a self-contained component that can be inserted into any web page, (subject to inclusion of any required JavaScript and CSS files).
The user can select the town that they wish to view the weather for from a fixed list given in the towns.sql database table.
The 'widget' displays a list of weather information (consisting of ‘current temp’, ‘current condition’, and ‘forecast condition’ (next day) for each of the selected towns, weather data is retrieved from weatherapi.com.
Weather information can be refreshed at any time.
The widget is embedded in the page and updated without the need to reload any other components of the page.

Please add your own api key from the weatherapi.com website.
